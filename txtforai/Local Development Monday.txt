Developing locally
Some of the examples in this repository require you to run a local server and expose it to the internet. To do so, you can either:

Use a tunneling service such as ngrok or localtunnel
Or utilize the monday apps CLI tool, which supports local development and tunneling out of the box. To do that, you will need to install node on your machine and then run the following:
npm i -g @mondaycom/apps-cli
mapps init -t <your-personal-token> (see here: https://developer.monday.com/apps/docs/quickstart-guide-for-monday-code#command-line-interface)
mapps tunnel:create inside the example directory you want to run
